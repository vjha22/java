                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi" target="_blank"> Narendra Modi</a> government
            completed 100
            days of its second term <span style="color:blue;"> (Modi 2.0)</span>last week. On this occasion, most
            cabinet
            ministers spoke of the achievements
            of their ministries. The headlines in newspapers were, however, about the abrogation of Article 370, or the
            biggest slump in auto sales in the last two decades, or the slowing down of GDP growth. I tried to search
            for
            bold moves in agriculture as it affects the largest number of people. But I couldn’t find any. Some
            already-announced schemes were tweaked and a few new ideas were offered but without solid scientific and
            financial backing.

            The <a href="http://pmkvyofficial.org/" target="_blank">PM-Kisan Yojana (PMKY)</a> — an income support of Rs
            6,000 per year to small and marginal farmer households —
            was announced before the parliamentary elections. Modi 2.0 has extended the scheme to the families of all
            farmers. The 2019-20 Union budget has provisioned Rs 75,000 crore for this scheme. This is the first step
            towards direct cash (income) transfer to farmers’ accounts. As I have argued earlier, this scheme will be
            meaningful if other subsidies — such as those on food, fertiliser, power and irrigation, and agri-credit —
            are
            clubbed with the PMKY and given directly to farmers. The move should be complemented by allowing market
            forces
            to set prices. Else, PMKY may come at the cost of investments in agriculture, which have fallen from a peak
            of
            18.2 per cent of the agri-GDP in 2011-12 to 13.7 per cent of the agri-GDP 2017-18. With such a fall in
            investments, the dream of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022 cannot be fulfilled.</p>
